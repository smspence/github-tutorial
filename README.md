# Your Challenge

1. Get in a group with 4-5 people.

2. Show off your knowledge of Gitflow with a README.

  - One team member must fork this repo.
  - That person must give everyone in the group access to edit the repo.
  - A "develop" branch must be created from the master.
  - Everyone must create their own "feature" branch named after your Github username, erase my answers, and respond to the questions below.
  - 2-3 people must merge their changes with "develop", then create one shared "release" branch and push to Github.
  - Another person then adds their changes to "develop", then "release", then push the updated "release" branch to Github as "master".
  - The last person must rebase to the new master branch, add their branch as a new "hotfix" branch, then merge it with master.
  - Another team member must make another hotfix branch to bold the questions.
  - One team member (different!) must submit a pull request to my repo with their group's changes.

3. Interact with a teammate's repo

  - Make sure you have at least 1 project on Github.
  - Look at a teammate's repo.
  - Star it.
  - Leave an issue report about the documentation: 
    - Do they have pictures that give you a good sense of what the project does?
    - Does the documentation explain the different methods and files in the projects?
    - Do their commit messages follow Udacity's style guide: https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/

4. Check out github.com/explore. Find one open source project that's interesting to you and star it (maybe a tool that you've worked with).
